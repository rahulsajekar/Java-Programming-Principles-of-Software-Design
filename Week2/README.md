# EarthQuakes Sorting Algorithms

In this module, you will continue using real earthquake data to explore several sorting algorithms. You will learn how to implement a selection sort and a bubble sort, then be introduced to a Java method Collections.sort, which sorts with much greater efficiency. By the end of this module, you will be able to 
1. implement several sorting algorithms from scratch, 
2. use efficient pre-existing sorting classes, 
3. modify a classâ€™s compareTo method to choose the criteria by which objects of that type are ordered, and 
4. write classes that implement the Comparator interface to create interchangeable sorting criteria.
