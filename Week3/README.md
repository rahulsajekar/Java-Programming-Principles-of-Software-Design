# N-Grams: Predictive Text
In this module, you will explore some of the underlying concepts of predictive text. The first lesson will introduce random character generation and then how to train the character selection based on an input text. The second lesson will extend this concept to complete words. By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. base random text generation on the frequency of characters in a training text, 
2. collect a set of characters that occur in a text after randomly chosen initial character(s) to create a semi-random text, 
3. extend the predictive text generation to use whole words, and 
4. implement your own .equals method to compare complex data types
